            <h3>About University</h3>
            <hr>
            Since the collapse of the state in 1991, a string of new universities emerged in Somali society as one of the collective initiatives to rebuild from the violence and material destruction of successive wars. Much has been achieved since then, as demonstrated in Somaliland (former British Protectorate where FFU is located) by the bottom-up restoration of peace, rebuilding of homes and society, development of government by democratic means, and the increasing emergence of universities in Somaliland from none until 1998 to over twenty-five today.

            Yet much more remains in advancing the wellbeing of a population traumatized by wars, disoriented by flawed governments, and impoverished by officially mismanaged resources. The universities too with rapidly growing enrollment have yet to promote quality education guided by a curriculum of high standard and taught by qualified teachers.
            
            Frantz Fanon University meets this standard in addition to competitively reasonable tuition fees and small-size classes. Not only does it enjoy reputation for quality education but also it develops a new generation of students in neglected but urgent priorities of Somali society like those described in the hyperlinked arrows on both sides of this page to overcome injuries of the past, improve the quality of life, advance social justice, and empower communities.
            
            Frantz Fanon University is a new and rapidly growing institution of higher education that catches the imagination and interest of Somali students, some of whom transfer in groups from other local universities because FFU offers: • High quality of university education in a society rebuilding from the ruins of war and whose restoration of peace in Somali society is growth of under-30 years-of-youth to over 75% of the population; • The only institution that trains urgently needed specialists (like psychiatrist, psychologists, forensic psychologists, and psychiatric nurses) in a region of high prevalence for post-traumatic stress disorders and other mental health problems, compounded also by absence of proper services; • Faculty of Medicine that has two programs: one whose duration is 6-year MD Degree Program and the other is a fast-track, 4-year MD Degree Program for applicants with prior training in premedical sciences; • Other faculties training students in diverse disciplines including public health, behavioral medicine, dentistry, pharmacology, criminology, conflict & development studies, entrepreneurship, and international relations and diplomacy; • Training specialists serving vital community needs like renewable energy (solar and wind) and drilling of wells for water or its conservation in a region of sparse rainfall and increasing desertification of the land for charcoal.
            
            Mission To train a new cadre of professionals whose practice and social commitment follow the example of Dr. Frantz Fanon while integrating state-of-the-art knowledge and technology to the culture and history of the people served.
            
            Goals • Train competent and socially committed professionals in health and other fields; • Assemble highly qualified professors imparting knowledge and technology consistent with the University's mission; • Develop an intellectual environment engaging all involved in critical thinking and research; • Link the University and its students to a wide network of universities and organizations at home as well as abroad; • Produce publications that educate, advocated, and share knowledge advancing social justice and wellbeing of individuals as well as communities.
            
            The motto of Frantz Fanon University is this: Breaking all chains, visible and invisible; building up from ruins, personal and social.
            
            Frantz Fanon University is committed to help remove chains which come in different forms, be they overt (as those used on psychiatric patients in Somali society) or covert as the oppressive systems and psychology perpetuating social injustice; it is also committed to help build up individual lives, families, and society from personal and social ruins resulting from either overt or covert chains.
            
            It is from this perspective of social justice that Frantz Fanon Universtiy aspires to direct and realize in its teaching of knowledge, skills, and practice.
            
            
            Why Frantz Fanon for Namesake? Frantz Fanon University is named for Dr. Frantz Fanon, the Afro-Caribbean psychiatrist and a leading contributor to the liberation of colonial Algeria from France. Dr. Fanon's books continue to inspire people in different parts of the world. They include: Black Skin, White Masks, A Dying Colonialism, The Wretched of the Earth, and Toward the African Revolution.
            
            Dr. Fanon's intellectual acumen, psychiatric innovation, and personal commitment are to this day relevant to Africans (including of course Somalis) and oppressed peoples globally. He demonstrated the power of ideas and bold action in pursuit of developing a humane and just world for all.
            
            Those who read his books and study his practice find much that can guide them toward professional integrity and compassionate service to under-served populations. Frantz Fanon University seeks to not only preserve Fanon's revolutionary legacy but also advance his commitment to social justice by teaching, writing, and serving communities in action.
            
            Taking Frantz Fanon for its namesake, FFU instills in its students the commitment of Dr. Fanon and its founder (Dr. Bulhan) to social justice for the poor and focusing on the urgent priorities of the population it serves. The University is open to qualified Somali students living in the Horn of Africa or abroad and to qualified international students regardless of nationality, race, or creed.
            
            The founder and President of Frantz Fanon University'
            
            The founder and President of Frantz Fanon University is Dr. Hussein A. Bulhan, a graduate of Harvared University, Boston University, and Wesleyan University. He is a Fanon scholar whose book, Frantz Fanon and the Psychology of Oppression (1985) is still widely read since its publication thirty years ago. He also published numerous articles and examples of the books whose cover pictures are shown in this page.
            
            A former tenured Professor at Boston University and Boston University School of Medicine, he taught both graduate and undergraduate students, supervising over 30 doctoral dissertations. He also treated patients of different of races, cultures, and economic status; he initiated in 1995 the Peace Committee that kick-started mediation of the 1994-1997 armed conflict in Somaliland; he co-founded in 1998 and served until 2004 as the Executive Director of the Academy for Peace and Development in Somaliland.
            
            From 2004 to the present, Dr. Bulhan treated as the Chief Clinician of Maandhaye Clinic numerous patients with diverse diagnoses. From 2008-2010, he served as the President/Chancellor for the University of Hargeisa, saving it from collapse. He now serves as the President of Frantz Fanon University while continuing to treat patients suffering from psychological/psychiatric disorders. </ref> He now teaches at Frantz Fanon University graduate students in psychiatry, public health, clinical psychology, and psychopharmacology in addition to teaching undergraduate courses in abnormal psychology and social psychology.
